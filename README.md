# picoCTF2021

This is a documentation for picoCTF2021 solutions, and I'm using the Kali linux on my virtual box.

## Obident cat 
* first download the file named, "flag"
* on the terminal type, "cat flag"
* should return, "picoCTF{s4n1ty_v3r1f13d_b5aeb3dd}"

## Mod 26
* Rot13 aka "Rotate by 13 places" is a subsitution cypher that replaces a letter with a 13th letter after it on the alphabet.
```
ABCDEFGHIJKLM
NOPQRSTUVWXYZ
```
* You can go on "https://rot13.com/" to translate (unless you want to do it by hand)
* should return, "picoCTF{next_time_I'll_try_2_rounds_of_rot13_ZNMldSDw}"
